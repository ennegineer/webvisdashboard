# Web Design - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

This website showcases the work done during the Weather Analysis API project. The plots shown on this site were generated directly from Python using Matplotlib and Pandas, on data generated with NumPy's random number generator as latitude and longitude combinations, then run through CitiPy to get city names, then the list of city names were used as the parameter in the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard from Real Data

The homepage of the visualization website explains what the weather analysis project was, and how it was completed. The plots, comparison, and data pages show more in-depth details on the project and analysis.

The dataset used came directly from my previous project. The dataset output csv is in the assets folder, along with the Python script used to convert the csv to html for the data table.
